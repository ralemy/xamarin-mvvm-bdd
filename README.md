# You are on the Barcode Branch

The **Barcode** branch was checked out from _Boilerplate.V1.2_ tag and demonstrates the use of Zxing libraries to turn the phone camera into a barcode scanner. 

This page Demonstraties the following Techniques:

* Overlaying two views using the Grid compoinent
* Using the ZXing libraries to scan a barcode
* Delegating events and properties to ViewModel
* Running code on UI Thread

# Xamarin MVVM App delevopment using BDD

This is an effort to provide step by step demonstration of how to develop a Xamarin app for iOS and Android using MVVM architecture and Behaviour Driven Development Methodology. 

Once the repository is cloned, in the Docs/ directory there is a xamarin-boilerplate.pdf file, which contains steps required to Install Visual Studio, add Specflow BDD extension, and setup a skeleton application with passing Sanity tests.

The pdf file also contains general and introductionary instructions on how to use the MVVM framework to navigate between pages and to delegate the code-behind to a more testable ViewModel object.

## Branches

The **Settings Branch** was checked out from _Boilerplate.V1.1_ tag. it demonstrates the following techniques:

* Adding a native Settings object
* Using constants inside XAML files
* Using a Xamarin Backdoor to write tests against internal objects 
* Creating double bindings between internal objects, ViewModels and Page components.
* Allowing time for UI and Backend update in tests

Based on the experience of this branch, a new _Boilerplate.V1.2_ tag is created, from which the future branches are checked out.
