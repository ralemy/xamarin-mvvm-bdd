# Xamarin MVVM App delevopment using BDD

This is an effort to provide step by step demonstration of how to develop a Xamarin app for iOS and Android using MVVM architecture and Behaviour Driven Development Methodology. 

Once the repository is cloned, in the Docs/ directory there is a xamarin-boilerplate.pdf file, which contains steps required to Install Visual Studio, add Specflow BDD extension, and setup a skeleton application with passing Sanity tests.

The pdf file also contains general and introductionary instructions on how to use the MVVM framework to navigate between pages and to delegate the code-behind to a more testable ViewModel object.

This work was inspired by [Rob Gibbens article for Specflow] (http://arteksoftware.com/bdd-tests-with-xamarin-uitest-and-specflow/)
